###Me trying to do some codesprint problems. Only the following works so far

* [Picking Cards][]
* [Quora Nearby][]
* [Coin Toss][]
* [Permutation][] (Passed sample test cases. Didn't know if went through final test cases)
    * TODO: Should also try doing this using the greedy algorithm to figure out permutation with largest value
* [Direct Connections][]
